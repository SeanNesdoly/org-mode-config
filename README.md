# org-mode-config

The `template.org` file contains a number of suitable default configurations for
creating `org` files that are destined to be exported to PDF. Below are some
alternative options for further customization:
- `#+LaTeX_CLASS: article, report, book`
- `#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [a4paper, twocolumn, titlepage, oneside, twoside,
  landscape]`

The `example.org` file provides a number of useful examples of `org`-mode syntax
that exports into correctly formatted PDF files. See `example.pdf` for the PDF
file that is rendered from the org file.

Some useful documentation on `org`-mode, `LaTeX`, and `magit` are stored in the
`docs/` directory; these were obtained from others, so credit is given to them
for their superb work.

Lastly, a number of common errors that I have come across, for which I have
solutions to, are listed in `org-mode-errors.org`.
