    Fix binding for "capitalize keywords" in sql-layer
        
    Noticed a new warning during startup saying that sqlup-mode is using "=c"
    where "=" is no prefix key. Noticed that the entire binding was not carried
    out in this case.
                            
    Therefore I have removed "=" from the binding but left it on "c" until enough
    text manipulations are available, then it should be moved to "x text
    manipulation" group instead.
