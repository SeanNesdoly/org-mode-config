    Fix binding for "capitalize keywords" in sql-layer
        
    Noticed a new warning during startup saying that sqlup-mode is using "=c"
    where "=" is no prefix key. Noticed that the entire binding was not carried
    out in this case.
                            
    Therefore I have removed "=" from the binding but left it on "c" until enough
    text manipulations are available, then it should be moved to "x text
    manipulation" group instead.

** Current emacs version as of [2019-12-10]: 25.3.1
* File mode specification error: (void-variable image-map)
Occurred after the following events:
    - Update of spacemacs repo to commit tag
      `072c01f5f52e5c0c92821ff9dda4c6278a1d7d48`
    - Update 133 emacs packages on [2019-12-10]

* Creating new snippets for ~yasnippet~
1. Run emacs command: ~yas-new-snippet~
2. Fill in snippet name, shortcut, and the snippet itself.
   - Tab cycling: ${1:}
   - Where to place cursor after tab cycling is completed: $0
3. To save snippet to private directory (not tracked by git): C-c C-n
   - Specify directory to save in as "org-mode" for snippets intended for
     ~org~-mode.
4. Copy created file to the default directory where yasnippet looks for snippets:
: cp ~/.emacs.d/private/snippets/org-mode/newSnippet ~/.emacs.d/elpa/26.3/develop/yasnippet-snippets-20191230.1405/snippets/org-mode/newSnippet
5. Finally, create a copy of the snippet to store in git:
: cp ~/.emacs.d/private/snippets/org-mode/newSnippet ~/org/snippets/newSnippet
